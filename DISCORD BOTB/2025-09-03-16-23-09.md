1. Push to GitHub

1. Unzip python-elite-guard.zip.


2. In that folder:



git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/python-elite-guard.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Python Elite Guard"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Now your repo lives at github.com/<your-username>/python-elite-guard.

2. Deploy from GitHub → a cloud host

Option A: GitHub Actions + Docker (self-host/EC2/VPS)

The repo already has a Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml.

You can run GitHub Actions to build & push Docker images → pull them on your server and run docker compose up.


Option B: GitHub → Render/Railway/Heroku/Fly.io

All of these connect directly to your GitHub repo.

Example (Render):

1. Go to Render → “New Web Service” → connect your GitHub.


2. Pick python-elite-guard repo.


3. Build command: Docker


4. Start command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


5. Add env vars:

DATABASE_URL (Render managed Postgres).

REDIS_URL (Render managed Redis).

SECRET_KEY (random string).



6. Add Worker service → same repo, command: python worker.py.


7. Add Scheduler service → same repo, command: python scheduler.py.




Option C: GitHub Pages (⚠️ not for APIs)

Pages only serves static sites. No FastAPI backend here. Stick to Render/Railway/Fly.io for APIs.

3. Flow

GitHub = source of truth.

Every push to main auto-builds on your host (Render/Railway/Fly.io).

API lives at https://your-app.onrender.com

Worker & Scheduler run off the same repo → all in sync.



---

4. Your Control Panel

Once deployed:

http://your-app/admin/bootstrap?email=admin@kartel.co&name=Bombay&password=change → bootstrap user + API key.

Use that key (x-api-key) for all /profiles + /campaigns routes.

Your GitHub commits = your product updates.
