**What is Karma Farming:**

Karma farming on Reddit refers to the practice of strategically posting popular or engaging content to accumulate karma points. Users gain karma when their posts or comments are upvoted, often by posting in trending subreddits or recycling viral content to increase visibility, credibility, and interaction rates on the platform 
 
**What Is Good Farming in Reddit’s POV:** 
 
There are known marketplaces where social media accounts can be bought and sold. However, the value of accounts is generally tied to engagement metrics so our bot along with seamless integration of scrolling and randomly connecting with posts, also likes, comments rather than just building karma. A study by the Digital Marketing Institute shows that accounts with high engagement rates but low karma can be more valuable because they indicate a real audience. Therefore, while karma farming might contribute to initial value, it is not the sole motivator.
